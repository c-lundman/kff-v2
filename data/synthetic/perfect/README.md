# Perfect Synthetic Datasets

This directory stores ground-truth queue scenarios used as reference data for evaluation.

## Current Scenario

- `day_2026-01-15/`

Files in each scenario folder:

- `events.csv`: per-pax FIFO-consistent entry and exit timestamps.
- `minute_flows.csv`: 1-minute in/out counts and end-of-minute occupancy.
- `summary.json`: scenario metadata and wait-time summary statistics.

## Generation

Generated by:

- `scripts/generate_perfect_dataset.py`

The generator is deterministic with a fixed random seed so the same files can be reproduced.
